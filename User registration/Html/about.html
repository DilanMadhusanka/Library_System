			<h2>Mission of the Online Library</h2>
			<p>The Online Library's mission is to develop and maintain online resources and services in support of the present and future teaching, learning and research needs of the University of London's Distance Learning community.</p>

			<p>We belive that:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Access to adequate library services and resources is essential for the attainment of superior academic skills in post-secondary education, regardless of where students, faculty, and programs are located.</li>

				<li>Members of the distance learning community are entitled to library services and resources equivalent to those provided for students and faculty in traditional campus settings.</li>
